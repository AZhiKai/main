== Overview

*MeNUS* is an all-in-one restaurant management desktop application. It is designed for restaurant managers to manage
 their menus, ingredients, sales and reservations conveniently and effectively - all in one place. It provides a
 Command Line Interface (CLI) for restaurant managers to interact with, and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 created with JavaFX. It is written with approximately 30 kLOC.

== Summary of contributions
* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=rebstan97[RepoSense]
* *Major enhancement*: Added *commands to manage a restaurant's ingredients*
** *What it does*: Allows the user to maintain a list of ingredients, as well as monitor and update their stock
counts.
** *Justification*: This feature is essential as restaurants often have a large number of ingredients to keep track
of, making it difficult to know immediately which ingredients require stocking up.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement involves adding several new commands to *MeNUS*. It requires understanding of
architecture components and integration with other features such as sales and menu management.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** To be updated.
