== PROJECT: MeNUS
---
This portfolio aims to provide a summary of my contribution as Team Leader for the project,
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-4/main[*MeNUS*].

== Overview

*MeNUS* is a restaurant management desktop application targeting restaurant owners in the National University
of Singapore (NUS). It is built to help them better manage core aspects of their restaurants  --  employees, menus,
inventory, sales and reservations -- all from a single location!

Restaurant owners interact with *MeNUS* using a Command Line Interface
(CLI). *MeNUS* also has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/[JavaFX] and it
is written using https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[Java 9] with
approximately 25 KLoC.

It is cross-platform supported and can be used on both Windows-based and Unix-based platforms.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *user management* feature
** *What it does*: Allows the restaurant owner to create account for each of his employee to manage the system on his
 behalf.
** *Justification*: This feature introduces the security layer by ensuring that only authorised employees are able to
 execute certain sets of commands, depending on their level of privilege.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement affects existing commands such that certain commands require the user to be
authenticated, otherwise it will not be executed. It required an in-depth analysis and understanding of the `Logic`,
`Model` and `Storage` components. The implementation too was challenging as it required modifications to existing
commands.
** *Credits*: Account password is secured using https://github.com/patrickfav/bcrypt[`bcrypt`].

* *Minor enhancement*: Added side navigation bar to allow access to the different components of the application with
a click of a mouse or trackpad.
** Navigation can also be done via CLI if user does not possess a mouse or trackpad.
