parameter which can be used as `deregister id/azhikai`.

`{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Italian`, `t/Italian t/Wednesday` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `id/USERNAME pw/PASSWORD`, `pw/PASSWORD id/azhikai`
is also acceptable.

2) The required ingredients to make one unit of `ITEM_NAME` is specified. +
