// tag::intro[]
== Welcome to MeNUS
This Developer Guide is written by the *MeNUS* v1.4 team for the benefits of future developers and maintainers of the
application.

* This guide includes instructions for setting up the development environment.

* This guide provides sufficient UMLs (unified model diagrams) to illustrate the architectural structure and design
methodology.

* This guide offers advice for troubleshooting some common issues.

*MeNUS* is an open-source project, should any developers be interested to contribute, see the
link:{repoURL}/docs/AboutUs.adoc[`Contact Us`] page for more information.

=== Legends
The following *3* legends will be used throughout the documentation which you may wish to pay attention to as it may
contain important details:

[NOTE]
Just for your info, do not be alarmed!

[TIP]
Perhaps something can be done using another approach, but it is up to you to decide.

[WARNING]
Some things might go wrong if you are not careful, or did not follow the instructions correctly; strongly advised to
read whatever is in this block.
// end::intro[]

== Setting up
Follow this setup guide to get *MeNUS* up and running on your computer.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`*
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9` which can be downloaded
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[here]

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFX plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/storage/XmlAdaptedAccount.java[`XmlAdaptedAccount.java`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/restaurant/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/restaurant/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.restaurant.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding
standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

=== Using Git with Sourcetree
We use Git with Sourcetree for distributed source control. See <<UsingGit#, UsingGit.adoc>> if you find any difficulty
when using Git with Sourcetree.

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1: Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.


image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2: Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeleteItem.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `RestaurantBookChangedEvent` when the Restaurant Book data are changed, instead of
asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeleteItemEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.4: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1: Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `AccountListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `DetailPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1: Structure of the Logic Component_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `RestaurantBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an account) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("register
id/azhikai pw/1122qq")` API call.

image::RegisterAccountSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2: Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

image::ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1: Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Restaurant Book data.
* exposes data via an unmodifiable `ObservableList` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this
list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1: Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Restaurant Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.restaurant.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedRestaurantBook`.
It extends `RestaurantBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `restaurantBookStateList` and
`currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedRestaurantBook#commit()` -- Saves the current restaurant book state in its history.
* `VersionedRestaurantBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous restaurant book state from its history.
* `VersionedRestaurantBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone restaurant book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#RestaurantBook()`, `Model#undoRestaurantBook()` and
`Model#redoRestaurantBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedRestaurantBook` will be initialized with the initial restaurant book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single restaurant book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `deregister id/azhikai` command to delete the account with the username of `azhikai` from the
restaurant book. The `deregister` command calls `Model#commitRestaurantBook()`, causing the modified state of the
restaurant book after the `deregister id/azhikai` command executes to be saved in the `restaurantBookStateList`, and
the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted restaurant book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `register id/azhikai ...` to add a new account. The `register` command also calls
`Model#commitRestaurantBook()`, causing another modified restaurant book state to be saved into the `restaurantBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitRestaurantBook()`, so the restaurant book state will not be saved into the `restaurantBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the account was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoRestaurantBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous restaurant book state, and restores the restaurant book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial restaurant book state, then there are no previous
restaurant book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoRestaurantBook()` to check if this is the
case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1.1: Structure of the Storage Component_

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoRestaurantBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer`
once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the restaurant book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `restaurantBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest restaurant book
 state, then there are no undone restaurant book states to restore. The `redo` command uses
 `Model#canRedoRestaurantBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than
  attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the restaurant book, such as
 `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitRestaurantBook()`, `Model#undoRestaurantBook()` or
 `Model#redoRestaurantBook()`. Thus, the `restaurantBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitRestaurantBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `restaurantBookStateList`, all restaurant book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire restaurant book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deregister`, just save the account being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of restaurant book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both
`HistoryManager` and `VersionedRestaurantBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::useraccount[]
=== User account feature
==== Current Implementation

The user account mechanism is facilitated by `RestaurantBook`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `RestaurantBook#getAccount(Account)` -- Retrieves the account.
* `RestaurantBook#addAccount(Account)` -- Saves the new account.
* `RestaurantBook#updateAccount(Account, Account)` -- Update the existing account.
* `RestaurantBook#removeAccount(Account)` -- Removes the account.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getAccount(Account)`, `Model#addAccount(Account)`,
`Model#updateAccount(Account, Account)` and `Model#removeAccount(Account)`. The following commands will
invoke the aforementioned operations:

* `Command#LoginCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#getAccount(Account)`.
* `Command#RegisterCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#addAccount(Account)`.
* `Command#DeregisterCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#removeAccount(Account)`.
* `Command#EditCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#updateAccount(Account, Account)`.

Described below are example usage scenarios and how each of the command and its respective operations behaves at each
step which involves two components, `Logic` which is responsible for parsing the user input and `Model` which is
responsible for manipulating the list, if necessary. Both components are extended by `LogicManager` and
`ModelManager` respectively.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `register` command works:

[NOTE]
The `deregister` command works the same way by checking if the account exists before calling `Model#removeAccount
(Account)`.

image::RegisterSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1.1: Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `register` command_

[NOTE]
We assume the user is already logged in
[NOTE]
If the username already exists, a warning message will be shown to the user to select another username

Step 1. The user executes `register id/azhikai pw/1122qq` command to create a new user account.

Step 2. `LogicManager` invokes the `RestaurantBookParser#parseCommand()` method which takes in the user input
as arguments.

Step 3. When the command is parsed, the `Command#RegisterCommand` will be created which is returned to the
`LogicManager`.

Step 4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute()` method of the `Command#RegisterCommand`, `rc` which is instantiated in
Step 3. The `Model` component will be involved as the `Command#RegisterCommand` invokes a request to add the account
into the storage by calling `Model#addAccount(Account)`.

Step 5: The new account is added into the storage. Then, a `CommandResult` is generated and returned to
`LogicManager` which is used to display the result to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `login` command works:

image::LoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1.2: Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `login` command_

[NOTE]
We assume the user will enter the correct password. Otherwise, warning message will be shown to the user to re-enter
the credential

Step 1. The user executes `login id/azhikai pw/1122qq` command to login to an existing user account.

Step 2. `LogicManager` invokes the `RestaurantBookParser#parseCommand()` method which takes in the user input
as arguments.

Step 3. When the command is parsed, the `Command#LoginCommand` will be created which is returned to the
`LogicManager`.

Step 4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute()` method of the `Command#LoginCommand` which is instantiated in Step 3.
The `Model` component will be involved as the `Command#LoginCommand` invokes a request to retrieve an account based
on the username. If it exists, the account will be retrieved and the password hash will be compared. If it matches,
then the credential is valid and the user is authenticated.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How account password is salted and hashed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use username to generate cryptographic salt.
** Rationale: If we allow the `bcrypt` library to generate the salt, test cases will be limited as the salt is
generated based on system time. This means that despite testing the same account with the same raw password, its
equality will never match. Hence, a workaround is to generate the salt based on its username which is unique to each
account.
** Pros: Easy to implement; simplified test cases
** Cons: If an attacker knows how the salt is generated, it could pose a security risk.
* **Alternative 2:** Use salt generated by the `bcrypt` library with high cost factor
** Pros: Higher cost factor makes hashing of the password harder. Ideally, the cost factor should as high as the
system can tolerate, given the other tasks the system must otherwise fulfill.
** Cons: More processing resources used and will affect testing ability.

=== User session feature
==== Current Implementation

[NOTE]
If a privileged command is executed when a session is not set, an error will be shown. The only commands that can
be executed without a session being set are `help`, `login` and `exit`. Any other commands are considered privileged

The user session is facilitated by `UserSession` which stores the authentication state of the application.
This is triggered by raising a `Login` and `Logout` event upon executing either the `Command#LoginCommand()` or
`Command#LogoutCommand()`. +

Additionally, it implements the following static operations:

* `UserSession#login()` -- Set a login session.
* `UserSession#logout()` -- Removes the existing login session.
* `UserSession#isAuthenticated()` -- Checks if there is an existing login session.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the user session mechanism behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user logs in or out:

image::UserSessionActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]
_Figure 4.2.1.3: Activity diagram to illustrate the user session_

The following code snippet demonstrates how these static methods are implemented:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Stores this {@link Account} info as part of this session.
 *
 * @param account logged in for this session.
 */
public static void create(Account acc) {
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
        isAuthenticated = true;
        account = acc;
    }
}

/**
 * Logs out of this account which releases this session.
 */
public static void destroy() {
        isAuthenticated = false;
        account = null;
}

/**
 * Updates the session with the new account info, such as updating of account password.
 *
 * @param acc that has been updated.
 */
public static void update(Account acc) {
    if (isAuthenticated) {
        account = acc;
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How user session is handled

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use static flags and methods.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Can only support one user at any time. If another user wants to login, the current logged in user must log out.
In addition, since it is a global class object, test cases may be affected when testing both guest and privileged
commands which requires user to be logged out and logged in respectively.
* **Alternative 2:** Store a list of user sessions to allow multiple login.
** Pros: More user can login and manage the systems concurrently. Potentially able to resolve the global dependency
of the current solution which might affect the test ability.
** Cons: More memory usage to track each user session as the application scales with more users.
// end::useraccount[]

// tag::auto-ingredient-update[]
=== Auto-ingredient update feature

The auto-ingredient update mechanism is facilitated by `RecordSalesCommand` and triggers whenever the "record-sales"
command is invoked. A `SalesRecord` will be instantiated based on the information given and attempts to compute
the ingredients used before deducting them from the ingredient list automatically.

==== Current Implementation

A `SalesRecord` is associated with 6 attributes - `Date`, `ItemName`, `QuantitySold`, `Price`, `Revenue` and
`IngredientUsed`. The success of the auto-ingredient update mechanism is subjected to the following conditions: +

[[condition]]
1) `ItemName` exists in the `Menu`.  +
2) The required ingredients to make one unit of `ItemName` is specified in the `Menu`. +
3) The required ingredients exist in the `Ingredient` list. +
4) There are sufficient ingredients to make `QuantitySold` units of `ItemName` in the `Ingredient` list.

[NOTE]
If any of the above conditions is not satisfied, the sales will be recorded without updating the ingredient
list.

[NOTE]
If conditions 1 and 2 are satisfied, `RecordSalesCommand` will compute all the ingredients used and store the data in
 `IngredientUsed` attribute of `SalesRecord`.

This mechanism is aided by methods from the `Menu` and `Ingredient` components, all of which are exposed in the
`Model` interface. Given below is an example scenario and how the auto-ingredient update mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `record-sales d/11-01-2018 n/Fried Rice q/35 p/5.50` command to record the sales volume of
`Fried Rice` on `11-01-2018`. A `SalesRecord` would be instantiated based on the command arguments given.

Step 2. `RecordSalesCommand` will request for the item `Fried Rice` from `Menu`. This is done through the `Item findItem
(Name)` method given in `Menu` component. This also checks if <<condition>> 1 is satisfied.

Step 3. `RecordSalesCommand` then proceeds to request for the required ingredients to make a unit of `Fried Rice`
from `Menu`. This is done through the `Map<IngredientName, Integer> getRequiredIngredients(Item)` method given
in `Menu`. This also checks if <<condition>> 2 is satisfied.

Step 4. With the required ingredients per unit data now at hand, `RecordSalesCommand` will compute the total
ingredients used in making `35` units of `Fried Rice`. This is done by multiplying required ingredients per unit by the
`35`. The `IngredientUsed` attribute in `SalesRecord` will then be updated.

Step 5. `RecordSalesCommand` will then pass the computed `IngredientUsed` to `Ingredient` component to request for
 an update of ingredients. This is done through the `void consumeIngredients(Map<IngredientName, Integer>)` method
 given in `Ingredient` component. This checks for <<condition>> 3 and 4.

Step 6. The `SalesRecord` is then finally added into `UniqueRecordList` via the `void addRecord(SalesRecord)`
method given in `Sales` component of `Model`.

[NOTE]
An exception will be thrown in step 2, 3 or 5 should the conditions be violated. When this happens,
`RecordSalesCommand` will proceed with step 6 instantly and omit the remaining steps.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `record-sales` command:

image::RecordSalesActivityDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Should the auto-ingredient update mechanism be incorporated when deleting sales?

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `DeleteSalesCommand` does not update the ingredient list. That is, it does not
"return" the ingredients which may or may not have been consumed during `record-sales`.
** Pros: Remove the possibility of unwanted updates to the ingredient list. This advantage is apparent when deleting
an obsolete record. We do not want the ingredients to "magically appear" in the ingredient list.
** Cons: If user accidentally recorded sales by mistake, deleting sales will not help him/her recover the consumed
ingredients. Instead, user will have to rely on the `Undo` command.

* **Alternative 2:** `DeleteSalesCommand` "returns" the consumed ingredients to the ingredient list.
** Pros: Resolves the issue stated in "Alternative 1 - Cons".
** Cons: Brings about the issue stated in "Alternative 1 - Pros".

===== Aspect: Should the auto-ingredient update mechanism be incorporated when editing sales?

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `EditSalesCommand` does not update the ingredient list. That is, it does not
"correct" the ingredients which may or may not have been consumed during `record-sales`. Furthermore, the
`IngredientUsed` attribute of the `SalesRecord` becomes invalid and hence removed permanently. There will be no
re-computation of `IngredientUsed`.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Avoids the implementation complexity as stated in "Alternative 2 - Cons"
** Cons: If user accidentally made an error while recording sales, editing sales will not help him/her alter the
ingredients consumed. What is consumed previously will stay as it is. Also, the `IngredientUsed` attribute will no
longer be available.

* **Alternative 2:** `EditSalesCommand` "corrects" the consumed ingredients by re-computing the `IngredientUsed`
attribute, "returning" the ingredients that were previously consumed and then passing the new `IngredientUsed` to the
ingredient list to update it.
** Pros: Resolves the issue stated in "Alternative 1 - Cons".
** Cons: Must take time into consideration when re-computing the `IngredientUsed` since "required ingredients per
unit" may get edited over time. Do we use the "required ingredients per unit" data present during record-sales, or do
 we use the data present during edit-sales? +
 If we use the former, then we would require a repository to store the history of the entire `Menu` whenever we
 record-sales. "Entire menu" so that data would be available should the `ItemName` gets edited in the future. This would
 take up a massive amount of memory space in the long run. Certainly not worth it just for an `edit-sales`. +
If we use the latter, then it would not make much sense. Say a glass of orange juice takes 1 orange to make at the
time of record-sales, and 3 oranges to make at the time of edit-sales. If the user edits the `QuantitySold` attribute
 from 1 to 10, he/she would certainly not want (3*10-1 = 29) oranges to be consumed from the ingredient list since it
 only took (1*10 = 10) oranges! Now what happens if the user wants to edit the `ItemName` "Orange Juice" to "Fruit
 Punch"? The ingredients required to make "Fruit Punch" might be available now, but we are not so sure if they were
 even available during `record-sales`!

// tag::displaySales[]
=== Display sales report feature
==== Current Implementation

The display sales report mechanism is facilitated by the Model, UI and Event components of the App. A `SalesReport`
class encapsulates the attributes of a sales report to be displayed.
The sales report is internally generated by `generateSalesReport(Date)` in `UniqueRecordList`. It then
propagates up the Model call hierarchy to `getSalesReport(Date)` in `ModelManager`, which is exposed in the `Model`
interface.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the display sales report operation works when the user enters
`display-sales 25-12-2017`:

image::DisplaySalesSequenceDiagram.png[width="1300"]

The sequence diagram for the "Parse Command" reference frame above is shown below:

image::DisplaySalesSequenceDiagramRef.png[width="580"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display sales report operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `display-sales 25-12-2017` command to request for the sales report dated 25-12-2017. The
`display-sales` command calls `Model#getSalesReport(Date)`, passing in the date "25-12-2017", and gets the generated
`SalesReport` in return.

[NOTE]
`display-sales` command will not call `Model#getSalesReport(Date)` if the specified date is invalid.

[NOTE]
If no sales record associated with the given `Date` is found, an empty SalesReport will be
returned. In such cases, the command will terminate with a message notifying the user about the absence of such record.

Step 2. The `display-sales` command then raises the `DisplaySalesReportEvent` event, which also encapsulates the
generated `SalesReport` in step 1.

Step 3. The `EventsCenter` reacts to the above event, which results in `handleDisplaySalesReportEvent(Event)`
in UI's `MainWindow` being called. This method instantiates a `SalesReportWindow` object by passing in the
`SalesReport` to its constructor. This `SalesReportWindow` acts as the controller for the sales report window.

Step 4. The `SalesReportWindow` is then initialized and displayed on user's screen.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How `SalesReport` is generated internally
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `generateSalesReport(Date)` in `UniqueRecordList` filters the entire record
 list. Records that match the given `Date` are added into an `ObservableList<SalesRecord>`. The `SalesReport` is
 generated based on the list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Execution is of linear time complexity and would be considerably slow should the list size be very large.
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain another list that sorts itself by date every time it is modified. Conduct a binary
search to fill in the `ObservableList<SalesRecord>` every time a sales report is requested.
** Pros: `SalesReport` can be generated with a O(logN) time complexity.
** Cons: Sorting after every input would require O(NlogN) time which is slow. Additionally, the sorted list also
takes up an O(N) memory space.
// end::displaySales[]

// tag::deleteingredient[]
===  Delete Ingredient feature
==== Current Implementation

The delete ingredient mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteIngredientCommand`. It is implemented as an abstract class
with the following abstract methods:

* `DeleteIngredientCommand#execute()` – Removes a specified ingredient from the list
* `DeleteIngredientCommand#equals()` – Checks if two `DeleteIngredientCommand` instances have the same attributes

`DeleteIngredientByIndexCommand` and `DeleteIngredientByNameCommand` extends `DeleteIngredientCommand` and implement
their own behaviour for these methods.

The following sequence diagrams illustrate how the delete operation works.

* Diagram 1: When user enters `delete-ingredient 1`

image::DeleteIngredientByIndexSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

* Diagram 2: When user enters `delete-ingredient apple`

image::DeleteIngredientByNameSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of delete ingredient command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate classes to handle deleting by index and deleting by name.
** Pros: Allows different attributes and method implementation for each class.
** Cons: Tight coupling between `DeleteIngredientCommand` and the inheriting classes
* **Alternative 2:** Single class to handle deleting by both index and name.
** Pros: Less coupling since the methods related to the delete ingredient command are confined to a single class.
** Cons: Two attributes are required, but only one has a value while the other has to be set to null. This makes the
`equals()` method difficult to implement.
// end::deleteingredient[]

// tag::menu[]
=== Menu Management feature
Menu management feature extends `MeNUS` with a menu and provides the users with the ability to add items to the
menu, edit items and remove items from the menu.

==== Current Implementation
The menu is stored internally as `items`, which is a `UniqueItemList` object that contains a list of `Item` objects.
The menu management feature implements the following operations:

* `add-item` command -- Adds an item to the menu. The item must not already exist in the menu.
* `edit-item` command -- Replaces the target item with the editedItem. Target item
 must be in the menu and editedItem must not be the same as another existing item in the menu.
* `delete-item-index` or `delete-item-name` command -- Removes the equivalent item(s) from the menu.
The item(s) must exist in the menu.
* `list-items` command -- Lists all the items in the menu.
* `clear-menu` command -- Removes all items from the menu.
* `select-item` command -- Selects an item in the menu and loads the page of the selected item.
* `sort-menu` -- Sorts the menu by name or price. The user must specify the sorting method.
* `find-item` command -- Finds items whose names contain any of the given keywords.
* `filter-menu` command -- Finds items whose tags contain any of the given keywords.
* `today-special` command -- Finds items whose tags contain the `DAY_OF_THE_WEEK`.
* `discount-item` command -- Gives discount to the equivalent item(s) in the menu. The item(s) must exist in the menu.
* `recipe-item` command -- Adds a recipe to the equivalent item in the menu. The item must exist in the menu.
* `add-required-ingredients` command --  Adds the required ingredients to the equivalent item in the menu. The item
must exist in the menu.

Each `Item` object consists of `Name`, `Price`, `Recipe`, `Set<Tag>` and `Map<IngredientName, Integer>`

==== `sort-menu` Command
The `sort-menu` command is facilitated by `SortMenuCommand` and `SortMenuCommandParser`. The command takes in
user input for the sorting method.
[NOTE]
Currently only sort by name or price

The `SortMenuCommandParser` will parse the user input and checks if the input is valid. If the input is valid, it
constructs an `SortMenuCommand` object.
[NOTE]
If the input is not valid, it will throw a `ParseException`

The `SortMenuCommand` object will indirectly call the `UniqueItemList#sortItemsByName()` or
`UniqueItemList#sortItemsByPrice()` and the sorts the menu.
After sorting the menu, it will save the current state for undo/redo.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `sort-menu` command:

image::SortMenuActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]
_SortMenu Activity diagram_

The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort-menu` command works:

image::SortMenuSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]
_SortMenu Sequence diagram_

==== `discount-item` Command
The `discount-item` command is facilitated by `DiscountItemCommand` and `DiscountItemCommandParser`. The command
takes in user input for discount percentage and index or the keyword `all`.

The `DiscountItemCommandParser` will parse the user input and checks if the input is valid. It will check if the
keyword `all` is entered. If keyword `all` is entered, `DiscountItemCommandParser` will construct an
`DiscountItemCommand` object with `isAll` set to true. If index or a range of index is entered, it will construct an
`DiscountItemCommand` object with `isAll` set to false.
[NOTE]
If the inputs are not valid, it will throw a `ParseException`

The `DiscountItemCommand` object will check if `isAll` is true. If `isAll` is true, it will give the discount to all
items in the `UniqueItemList`. Otherwise, it will give the discount to the item(s) specified by the index or the
range of index. The `DiscountItemCommand` object create an `Item with discounted price` and indirectly call
`UniqueItemList#setItem(Item target, Item editedItem)` to update the `Item` with `Item with discounted price`. It will
then save the current state for undo/redo.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `discount-item` command:

image::DiscountItemActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]
_DiscountItem Activity diagram_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `Price` is parsed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Price` is parsed without the currency symbol.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Only able to display `Price` with `$` with 2 decimal place.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to enter the currency symbol
** Pros: Able to display the different currencies.
** Cons: Harder to parse as currencies have different decimal places. Additional checks need to be implemented
to check if the currency symbol and price entered are valid.
// end::menu[]

//tag::reservations[]
=== Reservations feature
The Reservations feature allows users to store customer reservations, view them, and to cancel them.

==== Current Implementation
The Reservations feature currently contains 3 commands to modify the `UniqueReservationsList` stored in `ModelManager`.

* `add-reservation` command - Adds reservations to the reservations list.
* `edit-reservation` command - Edits existing reservations in the reservations list.
* `delete-reservation` command - Deletes existing reservations in the reservations list.

Each `Reservation` object contains `Name`, `Pax`, and `LocalDateTime`.

==== `add-reservation` Command
The `add-reservation` command follows similar implementation of the current `add` command.

The command takes in 3 parameters, `Name`, `Pax`, and `DateTime` to create a `Reservation` object.

After the `Reservation` Object is created, RestaurantBook#addReservation(Reservation reservation) is called to add the
`Reservation` Object to the `UniqueReservationsList`.

==== `edit-reservation` Command
The `edit-reservation` command follows similar implementation of the current `edit` command.

The command takes in 1 mandatory parameter, `Index`, followed by **1 or more** of the following  optional parameters,
 `Name`, `Pax`, `DateTime`.

The `Reservation` associated with the given `Index` is then identified within the internal `UniqueReservationsList`,
then has its values updated to the new values specified by the `Name`, `Pax`, and `DateTime` parameters.

==== `delete-reservation` Command
The `delete-reservation` command follows similar implementation of the current `delete` command.

The command takes in 1 parameter, `Index`.

The `Reservation` associated with the given `Index` is then identified, then deleted from the internal
`UniqueReservationsList`.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect: How DateTime is stored*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Reservation` stores the Date and Time by wrapping it in a `LocalDateTime` object.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Unable to easily change attributes like how the Date and Time are displayed, and unable to store Message
Constraints as it is not its own dedicated class.

* **Alternative 2:** Create dedicated `DateTime` class.
** Pros: This will solve the aforementioned issues of not having a dedicated class to store the Date and Time.

*Aspect: How DateTime is parsed*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `DateTime` is parsed in the format ``yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss``
** Pros: Easy to implement as the `LocalDateTime` object can directly parse this format without any additional input
manipulation.
** Cons: Unintuitive and troublesome to enter the fields. Additionally, it is unnecessary to keep track of the
`Seconds` field in the context of restaurant reservations.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `Natty` library for `DateTime` parsing
** Pros: Natty uses natural language parsing, so the user can enter the `Date` and `Time` fields in their preferred
format.
//end::reservations[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.restaurant.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.restaurant.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.restaurant.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.restaurant.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

**Problem: Test failed with `Missing newline at end of file`.**

* Reason: A newline is missing in the file.
* Solution: `File` > `Settings...` > `Editor` > `General` > `Ensure line feed at file end on Save`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/restaurant/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Restaurant Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size). +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).
